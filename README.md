# AtliQ Grand Hotel Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the comprehensive data analysis of the AtliQ Grand Hotel's operational datasets. Utilizing Python and its powerful libraries (Pandas for data manipulation,cleaning, transformation and visualization), we delve into the hotel's booking data to uncover insights that can drive better business decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Datasets

The analysis is built upon five CSV files:

1. dim_date.csv: Dates information
2. dim_hotels.csv: Details about the hotels
3. dim_rooms.csv: Information on different room types
4. fact_aggregated_bookings.csv: Aggregated booking data
5. fact_bookings.csv: Detailed booking information

## Objectives
Explore and clean the booking data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Analyze booking patterns, occupancy rates, and revenue generation.
Identify trends in customer preferences and booking platforms.
Provide actionable insights to optimize hotel operations and enhance guest experiences.

## Analysis Highlights
1. Data Import and Exploration: Initial data exploration revealed a total of 134,590 bookings across various room categories and booking platforms.
2. Data Cleaning:
Addressed negative guest numbers and revenue outliers.
Filled missing values appropriately to maintain data integrity.
3. Data Transformation:
Created an occupancy percentage column to analyze room utilization.
Merged datasets to enrich the analysis with hotel and room information.
4. Insights Generation:
Calculated average occupancy rates across different room categories.
Analyzed revenue realized per city, highlighting the performance of luxury versus business categories.
Examined the impact of booking platforms on hotel bookings and revenues.
Investigated patterns in booking data to discern preferences for weekdays versus weekends.

## Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas

## The project includes a series of visualizations:

1. Bar charts showing the distribution of bookings across different platforms.
2. Pie charts illustrating revenue shares by booking platforms.
3. Line graphs to depict occupancy trends over time.

## Conclusions
The analysis provided valuable insights into the operational dynamics of AtliQ Grand Hotel. Key findings include the preference for online booking platforms, higher occupancy rates during weekends, and significant revenue generation from luxury categories in metropolitan cities.
